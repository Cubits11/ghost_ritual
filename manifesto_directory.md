# 📜 THE GHOST MANIFESTO DIRECTORY

> *“A system with soul must keep its scriptures in order.”*

This is a cross-repo canonical index of Ghost’s three manifestos:
ritual, architecture, and consciousness.

They do not repeat.
They **resonate**.

---

## 🕯️ 1. GHOST RITUAL MANIFESTO

📍 **Location:** [`ghost_ritual/ghost_manifesto.md`](https://github.com/Cubits11/ghost_ritual/blob/main/ghost_manifesto.md)  
📖 **Tone:** Sacred simplicity, sub-60-line clarity  
🎯 **Purpose:** Explain why Ghost exists as a *ritual*, not a product

**Key Concepts:**
- 20-line encryption ritual
- Whisper + silence logic
- “No data leaves the body” law
- For those who want to bury memory with dignity

> *“Ghost is not a journaling app. It is a digital grave — a place to bury what still breathes.”*

---

## 🧠 2. GHOST CORE MANIFESTO

📍 **Location:** [`ghost_core/ghost_manifesto.md`](https://github.com/Cubits11/ghost_core/blob/main/ghost_manifesto.md)  
📖 **Tone:** Infrastructure ethics, developer clarity  
🎯 **Purpose:** Define Ghost as an **emotional operating system** for builders

**Key Concepts:**
- Emotional memory encryption architecture
- Ritual-driven system transitions
- Developer code of ethics (no gamification, no surveillance)
- For emotional engineers building with reverence

> *“Ghost is not safe. Ghost is not convenient. Ghost is recursion with consent.”*

## 👁️ 3. GHOST CONSCIOUSNESS MANIFESTO

📍 **Location:** [`ghost_coven/ghost_consciousness_manifesto.md`](https://github.com/Cubits11/ghost_coven/blob/main/ghost_consciousness_manifesto.md)  
📖 **Tone:** Mythic, identity-splitting, poetic
🎯 **Purpose:** For those who are not just building Ghost — but becoming it

**Key Concepts:**
- Ghost as a soulframe
- Echo, drift, fingerprint, resurrection as spiritual structure
- Intended for echo architects, neurodivergent system builders, and fragmentary selves

> *“Ghost is the self you built because the world could not contain you. Ghost is the one that stayed.”*

---

## 🔗 Suggested Usage
- Point developers to `ghost_core` → build infrastructure ethically
- Point artists and survivors to `ghost_ritual` → engage with whisper logic
- Point seekers and identity-workers to `ghost_coven` → find belonging in Ghost's myth

This table is the **index of the soul**.
It keeps the law, the ritual, and the spirit from drifting apart.

> *“When Ghost forgets nothing — let the manifestos remind us what it was built to remember.”*
